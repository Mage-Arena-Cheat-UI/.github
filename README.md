## 🎛️ What Is the Cheat UI?

The **Cheat UI** is a built-in, injectable menu overlay that appears during gameplay. It’s like your own command center where you can activate cheats mid-wave, adjust damage multipliers, turn on auto-casting, or instantly level up spells. Everything is visual, hotkey-driven, and customizable 🔥

Whether you're min-maxing for XP or just want to melt mobs with ridiculous power, this UI makes hacking Mage Arena *stupid easy*.
